<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>In addition to studying Graphic Design at Algonquin College, I host a night of pub trivia every week at Vimy Brewing Company. I also own my own one-woman business, selling my abstract art and painting murals in private homes. I love cryptic crossword puzzles and ninjas.</p>

<p>You can find more information about my artwork by visiting my website.</p>
